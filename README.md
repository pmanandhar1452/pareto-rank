# pareto-rank
Algorithms for ranking performance using the Pareto principle

## Motivation
This repository implements algorithms to rank optimization algorithms or teams that work in generating tradespaces, and choosing design solutions based on their performace in the utility vectory space. The term "problem-space" is also used to describe the space spanned by the utilities. We started this repository as we found the algorithms to be documented in the literature, but did not find open-source implementations that was easy to use.

## Run tests
```python -m unittest discover -p "Test*.py"```
