# pareto-rank
Algorithms for ranking performance using the Pareto principle

## Motivation
This repository implements algorithms to rank optimization algorithms or teams that work in generating tradespaces, and choosing design solutions based on their performace in the utility vectory space. We also use the term "problem-space" to describe the space spanned by the utilities. We started this repository as I found the algorithm to be documented in the literature but did not find an open-source implementation that was easy to use.
